			A Datamodel for PFS
			===================

(The cognoscenti will recognise certain similarities to the SDSS model,
    http://data.sdss3.org/datamodel/files/BOSS_SPECTRO_REDUX/RUN2D/PLATE4
)

There are implementations of python classes that represent many of the files in this document, supporting
reading and writing FITS files that conform to this model.  To use them, add the python directory in this
package to your $PYTHONPATH and import e.g. pfs.datamodel.pfsConfig


I shall use these symbolic names in the discussion:

NFIBER      The number of fibres in a spectrograph (some spectrographs have "missing" fibres)
NCOLUMN     The number of columns in our detectors (different for CCDs and HgCgTe?)
NROW        The number of rows that spectra extend over in the dispersion direction.
	    In practice, the number of rows in the usable part of the CCD.
NSIMROW     Number of rows for simulated data.  May be different in different files, depending
	    on the desired oversampling.
NCOARSE     Number of wavelengths used in computing the coarse
      (low-resolution) covariance matrix of the spectra

The values of NCOLUMN and NROW may be different in the optical and IR arms, and will differ for
raw and reduced data.  Possible values are given in the section, "Parameters"

In various places I refer to a SHA-1, which is a strong 160-bit hash, as used by e.g. git
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1).  We truncate these hashes to 63bits (so as to fit
in standard 64-bit signed integers). Sixty-three bits would produce up to 2^63 ~ 9e18 values.
These SHA-1 values are encoded into 16 hexadecimal digits in filenames.
In filenames, hexadecimal characters shall be
written in lower case (0x12345abcdef not 0X12345ABCDEF or 0x12345ABCDEF).

The following variables are used in filename formats (which are written in python notation):

site
  J: JHU
  L: LAM
  X: Subaru offline
  I: IPMU
  A: ASIAA
  S: Summit
  P: Princeton
  F: simulation (fake)

category (camera)
  A: Science
  B: UTR (Up The Ramp)
  C: Metrology Camera
  D: Auto-guider

visit
  An incrementing exposure number, unique at any site

spectrograph
  1-4

armNum
  1:  Blue
  2:  Red
  3:  IR
  4:  Medium resolution red
(used only in raw filenames)

arm
  b: Blue
  r: Red
  n: IR
  m: Medium resolution red

tract
  An integer in the range (0, 99999) specifying an area of the sky

patch
  A string of the form "m,n" specifying a region within a tract

objId
  A unique 64-bit object ID for an object.  For example, the HSC object ID from the database.

  objIds are written out using %016x formats for compactness reasons.

catId
  A small integer specifying the source of the objId.  Currently the following catIds are defined.

    catId |  description

pfsDesignId
  An integer uniquely specifying the configuration of the PFI; specifically a SHA-1 of the
  (fiberId, ra, dec) tuples (with position rounded to the nearest arcsecond) truncated to 64 bits.

  See calculate_pfsDesignId() in
	python/pfs/datamodel/utils.py

  We include the standard prefix "0x" in filenames to visually separate SHA-1s from 64-bit objId; this is
  especially important in pfsObject filenames which have both an objId and a hash.

  An alternative to a SHA-1 would be the visit number of the first data taken with this configuration but that
  would have the disadvantage that it would not be available until the data was taken.

  Lab data may choose to set the pfsDesignId to 0x0.
  A pfsDesignId of 0x0 means that no fibres are illuminated.


pfsVisitHash

  An integer uniquely defining the set of visits contributing to a reduced spectrum;
  this will be calculated as a SHA-1 truncated to 64 bits
  See calculate_pfsVisitHash() in
	python/pfs/datamodel/utils.py

As a special case, if the only visit is 0, pfsVisitHash shall be taken to be 0x0 for the convenience
of simulation code.

MaskedImage

  A data type which consists of three images:
     A floating point image
     An integer mask image
     A floating point variance image

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Auto-Guider image data

The file name format is as follows:
    "agcc_{pfs_visit:06d}_{agc_exposure_id:08d}.fits"

Where agc_exposure_id is a unique integer (monotonically increasing exposure by exposure).

This data contain the following mandatory tables:

HDU #0 PDU
HDU #1 CAM1            [16-bit INT]      NPIXEL
HDU #2 CAM2            [16-bit INT]      NPIXEL
HDU #3 CAM3            [16-bit INT]      NPIXEL

HDU #5 CAM5            [16-bit INT]      NPIXEL
HDU #6 CAM6            [16-bit INT]      NPIXEL

And the following optional tables:

HDU #7 TABLE1          FITS binary table
HDU #8 TABLE2          FITS binary table
HDU #9 TABLE3          FITS binary table

Raw Data

From the spectrograph cameras:

   "PF%1sA%06d%1d%1d.fits" % (site, visit, spectrograph, armNum)

Format: as written by the DAQ system.  The "A" (science) frames are a single image
extension of size > NCOLUMN*NROW due to extended registers and overclocks, even for the red and blue arms
whose "detectors" consist of two physical devices.

N.b. the restriction to filenames of the form 4 letters followed by 8 decimal digits comes from Subaru.

Note that the order of the last two numbers is "spectrograph, armNum" whereas in all other filenames
we use the order "arm, spectrograph" but now arm is a string (e.g. r2, n4).

From the MCS:

   "PF%1sC%06d%02d.fits" % (site, visit, sequenceId)

Where a sequenceId is used to identify the individual frames.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Calibration products (i.e. processed flats/biases/darks ready to be used in processing)

   "pfsFlat-%s-%06d-%1s%1d.fits" % (calibDate, visit0, arm, spectrograph)
   "pfsBias-%s-%06d-%1s%1d.fits" % (calibDate, visit0, arm, spectrograph)
   "pfsDark-%s-%06d-%1s%1d.fits" % (calibDate, visit0, arm, spectrograph)

(While theoretically we don't need to distinguish between the r and m chips, it's simpler to be
consistent, so we will have 16, not 12, biases/darks for the complete spectrograph)

Visit0 is the first visit for which these flats/biases/darks are valid; in general
there will be many files for each (arm, spectrograph) but with different values of visit0.  Note that we
don't know the upper range of validity when these files are created, so it cannot be encoded in the filename.

Visit0 is usually the last input visit used in preparing the calibration files. The calibration file that is
used by the pipeline is selected based on a list of valid dates provided to the calibration database; visit0
is only used to provide a unique filename and a sensible sort order.

Single extension fits files of size NCOLUMN*NROW

Calibrated images

    "postISRCCD-%1s%1s%06d-%1s%1d.fits" % (site, category, visit, arm, spectrograph)
    "calexp-%1s%1s%06d-%1s%1d.fits" % (site, category, visit, arm, spectrograph)

These are persisted versions of LSST's lsst.afw.image.Exposure class. As such,
they may include a variety of HDUs for persisting PSFs, etc., but most notable
are the following:

HDU #0 PDU
HDU #1 IMAGE            [32-bit FLOAT]      NPIXEL
HDU #2 MASK             [32-bit INT]        NPIXEL
HDU #3 VARIANCE         [32-bit FLOAT]      NPIXEL
...

The profile of fibers in the 2-D flat-field image:

  "pfsFiberProfiles-%s-%06d-%1s%1d.fits" % (calibDate, visit0, arm, spectrograph)

Note that visit0 is defined under "Calibration products"

For each fiber, an empirical, oversampled profile (in the spatial dimension, columns) is recorded for several
positions along the fiber trace in the spectral dimension (rows).

HDU #0 PDU
HDU #1 FIBERS     Profile parameters for each fiber              [BINARY FITS TABLE]   NFIBER
HDU #2 PROFILES   Profile measurements                           [BINARY FITS TABLE]   NPROFILES

Profile parameters in the FIBERS HDU are:
        fiberId     32-bit int              Fiber identifier (primary key)
        radius      32-bit int              Half-size of profiles, in native pixels
        oversample  32-bit float            Oversampling factor (> 1)
        norm        32-bit float vector     Normalisation to apply to extracted spectra

Profile measurements in the PROFILES HDU are:
        fiberId     32-bit int              Fiber identifier (primary key)
        rows        32-bit float            Detector row at which the profile is measured (primary key)
        profiles    32-bit float vector     Measured profile
        masks       boolean vector          Whether values in the profiles should be used (1 = don't use)

The length of a profile (and mask) vector is: int(2*(radius + 1)*oversample) + 1.

The PDU has keys to define which data were used to construct the FiberTrace:
   SPECTROGRAPH       Which spectrograph
   ARM                The arm of the spectrograph
   CALIB_INPUT_%d     Visits which were used
I.e. if only visit 5830 were used, the r1 file would have ARM='r', SPECTROGRAPH=1, CALIB_INPUT_0=5830

The mapping of fiberId,wavelength to x,y on the detector:

  "pfsDetectorMap-%06d-%s%1d.fits" % (visit0, arm, spectrograph)

Note that visit0 is defined under "Calibration products"

We have multiple separate formats for representing the "detectorMap", which are distinguished by the value of
the "HIERARCH pfs_detectorMap_class" header card:
* SplinedDetectorMap: splines for each fiber provide the wavelength and column as a function of row.
* DoubleDetectorMap: mapping of x,y to dx,dy distortion for left and right CCDs to a SplineDetectorMap.
  This is deprecated in favor of MultipleDistortionsDetectorMap.
* DifferentialDetectorMap: a mapping of fiberId,wavelength to x,y corrections to a SplinedDetectorMap.
  This is deprecated and due to be removed.
* DistortedDetectorMap: a mapping of x,y to dx,dy corrections to a SplinedDetectorMap.
  This is deprecated and due to be removed.
* MultipleDistortionsDetectorMap: multiple mappings of x,y to dx,dy corrections to a SplinedDetectorMap.

The design of a PFI setup, i.e., the targetting of fibers, is a PfsDesign:

    "pfsDesign-0x%016x.fits" % (pfsDesignId)

The choice of a hex format is because the the pfsDesignId is a SHA-1
of the intended fiber positions.

FITS file format:

HDU #0 PDU
HDU #1          FITS binary table named "DESIGN"
HDU #2          FITS binary table named "PHOTOMETRY"
HDU #3          FITS binary table named "GUIDESTARS"

The PDU contains the following keys:

      DSGN_NAM  Human-readable name for the design
      RA        Intended telescope boresight Right Ascension (degrees)
      DEC       Intended telescope boresight Declination (degrees)
      POSANG    Intended Position Angle of the PFI (degrees).
                    This corresponds to the angle
                    from the North Celestial Pole to the PFI_Y axis,
                    measured clockwise looking along the positive PFI_Z axis
                    (ie., the telescope pointing direction).
      ARMS      The arms that will be exposed.
                    This can be any combination
                    of the arms 'b', 'r', 'm', and 'n'
                    (where each arm can
                    appear only once
                    and 'r' and 'm' cannot be present
                    in the same combination)
                    examples: 'brn', 'bmn', 'rb'.

The DESIGN table lists for each object:
      fiberId        32-bit int
      catId          32-bit int
      tract          32-bit int
      patch          string
      objId          64-bit int
      ra             64-bit float (degrees)
      dec            64-bit float (degrees)
      targetType     32-bit int (enumerated type: e.g. SCIENCE,SKY,FLUXSTD)
      fiberStatus    32-bit int (enumerated type: e.g. GOOD,BROKENFIBER,BLOCKED,BLACKSPOT)
      pfiNominal     pair of 32-bit floats (millimeters on the PFI)
      epoch          7-character string (e.g., J2000.0, see also the definition for the GUIDESTARS table)
      pmRa           32-bit float (mas/yr)
      pmDec          32-bit float (mas/yr)
      parallax       32-bit float (mas)
      proposalId     string
      obCode         string

Note that:
* the fiberIds start at 1.
* the combination of (catId, objId) must be unique
    [with the exception where (catId=-1 objId=-1) which corresponds to an untargeted fiber.]
* the proposalId is a string for each proposal assigned by Subaru Telescope (e.g., S24B-001QN)
* the obCode is a string for an Observing Block (OB) within a proposal. An OB consists of a combination of
    a target, exposure setup, and QA constraints. The combination of (proposalId, obCode) must be unique.

The 'targetType' in the DESIGN table is an enumerated type, with values:
    SCIENCE = 1: The fiber is intended to be on a science target.
    SKY = 2: The fiber is intended to be on blank sky, and used for sky subtraction.
    FLUXSTD = 3: The fiber is intended to be on a flux standard, and used for flux calibration.
    UNASSIGNED = 4: The fiber is not targeted on anything in particular.
    ENGINEERING = 5: The fiber is an engineering fiber.
    SUNSS_IMAGING = 6: The fiber is fed by SuNSS imaging leg.
    SUNSS_DIFFUSE = 7: The fiber is fed by SuNSS diffuse leg.
    DCB = 8: Fiber is fed by DCB/DCB2.
    HOME = 9: Cobra is going to its home position.
    BLACKSPOT = 10: Cobra is going behind the black spot.
    AFL = 11: The fiber is fed by all fiber lamp cable.

The 'fiberStatus' in the DESIGN table is an enumerated type, with values:
    GOOD = 1: The fiber is working normally.
    BROKENFIBER = 2: The fiber is broken, and any flux should be ignored.
    BLOCKED = 3: The transmission through the fiber is temporarily blocked. Any flux should be ignored.
    BLACKSPOT = 4: The fiber is hidden behind its spot, and any flux should be ignored.
    UNILLUMINATED = 5: The fiber is not being illuminated.
    BROKENCOBRA = 6: The cobra cannot move, but the fiber still carries flux.


The PHOTOMETRY table lists:
      fiberId            32-bit int
      fiberFlux    [nJy] 32-bit float
      psfFlux      [nJy] 32-bit float
      totalFlux    [nJy] 32-bit float
      fiberFluxErr [nJy] 32-bit float
      psfFluxErr   [nJy] 32-bit float
      totalFluxErr [nJy] 32-bit float
      filterName         string

Where the:
    * fiberFlux corresponds to the integrated flux within an aperture of a fiber
        (approx 1 arcsec in diameter). This is seeing-corrected.
    * psfFlux is the flux computed by fitting the appropriate PSF to the image,
        to an infinite radius.
    * totalFlux is the complete flux for that object. This is the same as the psfFlux
        for unresolved sources, but for extended sources the appropriate extended model
        is applied to compute the flux.


A fiberId may be listed multiple times in the PHOTOMETRY table in order to
provide measurements in multiple filters for a single object.

The 'filterName' values in the PHOTOMETRY table will specify particular
transmission curves used by the pipeline, and therefore the range of
permitted values is limited to a set to be specified by the DRP team.
There will be a mechanism for adding to this set.

The GUIDESTARS table lists:
      objId          64-bit int
      epoch          7-character string
      ra             64-bit float (degrees)
      dec            64-bit float (degrees)
      pmRa           32-bit float (mas/year)

      agX            32-bit float (pixels)
      agY            32-bit float (pixels)

Where the:
    * objId corresponds to the unique object identifer for the guide star
    * epoch corresponds to the reference epoch for the stellar parameters,
      in the form PYYYY.x, where P is the prefix (J for Julian or B for Besselian epochs),
      YYYY is the whole year for the epoch,
      and x is the fraction of Julian years from the whole year, or 0 for Besselian epochs.
    * ra corresponds to the Right Ascension of the guide star
    * dec corresponds to the Declination of the guide star
    * pmRa is the proper motion of the guide star along the RA direction
    * pmDec is the proper motion of the guide star along the DEC direction
    * parallax is the observed parallax of the guide star
    * magnitude is the magnitude for the guide star
    * passband is the passband over which the magnitude is measured.
    * color is the Gaia broadband BP-RP color for that guide star.
    * agId is the identifier for the AG camera that will observe that guide star.
        This can have a value from 0 to 5 inclusive.
    * agX is the X-position on the corresponding AG camera where the guide star
          is expected to be detected
    * agY is the Y-position on the corresponding AG camera where the guide star
          is expected to be detected

Additional keywords are required for the GUIDESTARS HDU:
    * EPOCH the reference epoch for the guide star data.
        All the guide star information share the same epoch.
        This should be accurate to the order of weeks to ensure that the
        parallax can be incorporated into the measurements.
        The format for the time is the ISO-8601 yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss format
        and the time coordinate is TCB.
    * TEL_ELEV the telescope elevation (degrees)
    * GS_CATID the identifier of the catalogue containing the guide stars.
        This implies that all the guide stars in this table originate from
        a single catalogue.

The realisation of a PfsDesign for a particular exposure is a PfsConfig.
The most important differences from PfsDesign are that the actual fiber
positions and object photometry are recorded for use in the DRP.

    "pfsConfig-0x%016x-%06d.fits" % (pfsDesignId, visit)

The choice of a hex format is because the the pfsDesignId is a SHA-1.

FITS file format:

HDU #0 PDU
HDU #1          FITS binary table named "CONFIG"
HDU #2          FITS binary table named "PHOTOMETRY"

The PDU has keys indicating the actual pointing of the telescope boresight.

      RA        Actual telescope boresight Right Ascension (degrees).
      DEC       Actual telescope boresight Declination (degrees).

The CONFIG table lists for each object:
      fiberId        32-bit int
      catId          32-bit int
      tract	         32-bit int

      targetType     32-bit int (enumerated type: SCIENCE,SKY,FLUXSTD,UNASSIGNED,ENGINEERING)
      fiberStatus    32-bit int (enumerated type: GOOD,BROKENFIBER,BLOCKED,BLACKSPOT,UNILLUMINATED)
      pfiCenter      pair of 32-bit floats (millimeters on the PFI)
      pfiNominal     pair of 32-bit floats (millimeters on the PFI)
      epoch          7-character string
      pmRa           32-bit float (mas/yr)
      pmDec          32-bit float (mas/yr)
      parallax       32-bit float (mas)
      proposalId     string
      obCode         string

(I.e., the same as for PfsDesign, except for the addition of the
"pfiCenter" column.)

The 'targetType' and 'fiberStatus' in the CONFIG table are the same enumerated
types as in the PfsDesign.

The PHOTOMETRY table is the same as for the PfsDesign.

Reduced but not combined single spectra from a single exposure (wavelength calibrated but not flux-calibrated)

   "pfsArm-%06d-%1s%1d.fits" % (visit, arm, spectrograph)

N.b. visit numbers are only unique at a site, but we don't preserve this in derived product names.  There will
keywords in the header to disambiguate this.

The file will have several HDUs:

HDU #0 PDU
HDU #1 FIBERID      Fiber identifier                        [32-bit INT]    NFIBER
HDU #2 WAVELENGTH   Wavelength (nm, vacuum)                 [64-bit FLOAT]  NROW*NFIBER

HDU #9 NOTES        Reduction notes                         [BINARY TABLE]  NFIBER*NNOTES

Note that the data need not be resampled onto a uniform grid, as a wavelength is provided for each pixel.

The COVAR data contains the diagonal COVAR[fiberId][0][0:]
                            +-1      COVAR[fiberId][1][0:-1]
and
                            +-2      COVAR[fiberId][2][0:-2]
terms in the covariance matrix.

At a minimum the CONFIG table contains columns for pfsDesignId and visit (and only one row!  But it's
a table not header keywords for consistency with the pfsObject file).

The reduction notes (NOTES) HDU is a FITS table HDU with one row for each fiber and a variety of columns.
The values record operations performed and measurements made during reduction for that fiber.

It would be possible to denormalise additional information about the observation into this HDU.  I do not
know if it should also contain things we've learned about the observation from the analysis that created
this file;  I'd be inclined to put it in a separate temporary file, and then build a single file describing
the entire PFS from the 12 temporaries.  Alternatively, this could be done at the database level.

2D spectral line measurements

The 2D pipeline measures the position and flux of sky and arc lines as part of the reduction process.
Note that science target lines are not included here.

As of 2022-07-22 (with the LSST Gen2-based pipeline), these are written in a single file:

    "arcLines-%06d-%s%d.fits" % (visit, arm, spectrograph)

In the future (with the LSST Gen3-based pipeline), the centroid and photometry measurements will be
written to separate files:

    "lineCentroids-%06d-%1s%1d.fits" % (visit, arm, spectrograph)
    "linePhotometry-%06d-%1s%1d.fits" % (visit, arm, spectrograph)

These FITS files will include a single table HDU (in addition to the mandatory empty PHDU) with columns:

2D spectral calibrations

The 2D pipeline measures and applies multiple calibrations to the spectra as part of the reduction process.

    "apCorr-%06d-%s%d.fits" % (visit, arm, spectrograph)
    "sky2d-%06d-%s%d.fits" % (visit, arm, spectrograph)
    "sky1d-%06d-%s.fits" % (visit, arm)
    "fluxCal-%06d.fits" % (visit,)

Each of these are functions of wavelength and position on the focal plane, but different representations.
The particular representation used is written in the PHDU as the value of the
"HIERARCH pfs_focalPlaneFunction_class" keyword.

* PfsConstantFocalPlaneFunction: a constant spectrum for the whole focal-plane.
  The FITS file includes the following HDUs:

    HDU #0 PDU
    HDU #2 WAVELENGTH   Wavelength (nm, vacuum)     [64-bit FLOAT]  LENGTH
    HDU #1 VALUE        Value of the function       [32-bit FLOAT]  LENGTH
    HDU #3 MASK         Is the value bad?           [8-bit UINT]    LENGTH
    HDU #4 VARIANCE     Error^2 of the value        [32-bit FLOAT]  LENGTH

* PfsOversampledSpline: a spline in wavelength for the whole focal-plane.
  The FITS file includes a "SPLINE" table HDU with ORDER (spline order) and
  DEFAULT (default value) header keywords and the following columns:

    knots       64-bit float
    coeffs      64-bit float
    wavelength  64-bit float
    variance    64-bit float

* PfsBlockedOversampledSpline: a spline for blocks of fiberId. The FITS file
  includes a "BLOCKSPLINE" HDU with the following columns:

    fiberId         32-bit float
    splineOrder     32-bit integer
    defaultValue    64-bit float
    knots           64-bit float array
    coeffs          64-bit float array
    wavelength      64-bit float array
    variance        64-bit float array

* PfsPolynomialPerFiber: a polynomial in wavelength for each fiber. The FITS file
  includes a "POLYPERFIBER" table HDU with MIN_WL (minimum wavelength) and
  MAX_WL (maximum wavelength) header keywords and the following columns:

    fiberId         32-bit integer
    coeffs          64-bit float array
    rms             64-bit float

* PfsFluxCalib: Flux calibration vector: h(lam) exp g(x,y,lam), where h(lam)
  is PfsConstantFocalPlaneFunction, and g(x,y,lam) is a polynomial.
  The FITS file includes the same HDUs as PfsConstantFocalPlaneFunction does,
  plus a binary table HDU named "POLYNOMIAL" defining g(x,y,lam). The last
  table has only a single row with the following columns:

    params          64-bit float array, length combination(order+3, 3)
    min             64-bit float array, length 3.
    max             64-bit float array, length 3.

  params[i] is the coefficient by which to multiply the term
  x^e[i][0] y^e[i][1] lam^e[i][2]. "e", array of 3-tuple of exponents, is
  in descending order of e[.][0] + e[.][1] + e[.][2]. Ties are broken in
  the reverse order of 3-tuple. For example, e = [(2,0,0),(1,1,0),(1,0,1),
  (0,2,0),(0,1,1),(0,0,2),(1,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,0,1),(0,0,0)] if order=2.

  min (max) is the vertex of the rectangular-parallelepipedal domain of the
  polynomial at which (x, y, lam) are minimal (maximal). Arguments of the
  polynomial are normalized so that min will be mapped to (0, 0, 0) and max
  to (1, 1, 1). This nomalization happens before the arguments are
  substituted for the variables of the polynomial.

Fiber normalizations

The fiber normalizations consist of polynomial coefficients used to correct the
normalization of fiber fluxes, so that the fluxes in different fibers may be
compared accurately.

    "pfsFiberNorms-%s-%06d-%s.fits" % (calibDate, visit0, arm)

The file contains multiple image HDUs:

HDU #3 VALUES       Normalization values    [64-bit FLOAT]      NFIBER*NROW
HDU #4 MODEL        Model details

The MODEL HDU contains the details of the model used to create the normalization
values. The format is not specified here, and varies according to the model.

Reference model

The reference model set is a product from `calculateReferenceFlux` and is stored in the pfsFluxReference file.
pfsFluxReference is used in the flux calibration procedure together with pfsMerged to produce flux-calibrated
spectra. pfsFluxReference include the wavelength and flux of the reference spectra of standard stars, as well
as fitting results. We propose that pfsFluxReference includes multiple objects in a visit like pfsMerged.

The reference model set is saved to:

"pfsFluxReference-%06d.fits" % (visit,)

The file has several HDUs:

HDU #0 PDU
HDU #1 FIBERID Fiber identifier [32-bit INT] NFLUXSTD
HDU #2 FLUX Flux of reference models in units of nJy [FLOAT] (the number of pixels of a model)*NFLUXSTD
HDU #3 FITFLAG Flag if the fitting was successful or not [32-bit INT] NFLUXSTD
HDU #4 FITPARAMS Table of by-products [BINARY TABLE]

NFLUXSTD is the number of fibers for flux standards, FLUXSTD.

PDU includes the visit number. HDU #3 includes the flag of whether the fitting process was successful or not.
This flag also includes the causes of failure. HDU #4 includes a binary table of by-products from
the calculateReferenceFlux process. HDU #4 includes at least the stellar parameters of the reference models,
the estimated radial velocity, the fitting parameters to continuum, the scaling factor, and Galactic
extinction.

Combined spectra.

In SDSS we used "spPlate" files, named by the plugplate and MJD of observation but this is not suitable for
PFS where we:
  1.  Will split observations of the same object over multiple nights
  2.  Will potentially reconfigure the PFI between observations.

I don't think it makes sense to put multiple spectra together based on sky coordinates as we may go back and
add more observations later, so I think we're forced to separate files for every object.  That's a lot of
files, but maybe not too bad?  We could use a directory structure based on HSC's (tract, patch) -- note that
these are well defined even if we are not using HSC data to target.  An alternative would be to use a
healpix or HTM id.

Because we may later obtain more data on a given object, or decide that some data we have already taken is
bad, or process a number of subsets of the available data, there may be more than one set of visits used
to produce a pfsObject file for a given object.  We therefore include both the number of visits (nVisit)
and a SHA-1 hash of the visits, pfsVisitHash.  We use both as nVisits may be ambiguous, while pfsVisitHash
isn't human-friendly;  in particular it doesn't sort in a helpful way.  It seems improbable that we will
ever have more than 1000 visits, but as the pfsVisitHash is unambiguous it seemed safer to only allow for
larger values of nVisit, but record them only modulo 1000.

     "pfsObject-%05d-%05d-%s-%016x-%03d-0x%016x.fits"
         % (catId, tract, patch, objId, nVisit % 1000, pfsVisitHash)

The wavelengths are specified via the WCS cards in the header (e.g. CRPIX1,
CRVAL1) for the FLUX, MASK, SKY, COVAR extensions and explicitly in the table
for the FLUXTABLE.  We chose these two representations for the data due to the
difficulty in resampling marginally sampled data onto a regular grid,  while
recognising the convenience of such a grid when rebinning, performing PCAs, or
stacking spectra.  For highest precision the data in the FLUXTABLE is likely to
be used.

The TARGET HDU must contain at least the keywords
    catId       Catalog identifier         INT
    tract       Tract identifier           INT

What resolution should we use for HDU #1?  The instrument has a dispersion per pixel which is roughly constant
(in the blue arm Jim-sensei calculates that it varies from 0.70 to 0.65 (going red) A/pix; in the red, 0.88 to
0.82, and in the IR, 0.84 to 0.77).  We propose that we sample at 0.8 A/pixel.

The second covariance table (COVAR2) is the full covariance at low spectral resolution, maybe 10x10. It's
really only 0.5*NCOARSE*(NCOARSE + 1) numbers, but it doesn't seem worth the trouble to save a few bytes.
This covariance is needed to model the spectrophotometric errors.

The reduction notes (NOTES) HDU is a FITS table HDU with a single row and a variety of columns.
The values record operations performed and measurements made during reduction for the spectrum.

Note that we don't keep the SDSS "AND" and "OR" masks -- if needs be we could set two mask bits to capture
the same information, but in practice SDSS's OR masks were not very useful.

For data taken with the medium resolution spectrograph, HDU #1 is expected to be at the resolution of
the medium arm, and to omit the data from the blue and IR arms.

Line-spread functions

The line-spread function (LSF) is the response of the spectrograph to a single
narrow line; it is the one-dimensional equivalent of the point-spread function
(PSF).

The datamodel representation for the LSF has not yet been settled. However, they
are temporarily represented as python pickles of instances of classes defined in
drp_stella (subclasses of pfs.drp.stella.Lsf; see the docstrings for API
details) so that they can be used in the mean time.

The LSFs will be saved to:
    "pfsArmLsf-%06d-%1s%1d.pickle" % (visit, arm, spectrograph)
    "pfsMergedLsf-%06d.pickle" % (visit,)
    "pfsSingleLsf-%05d-%05d-%s-%016x-%06d.pickle" % (catId, tract, patch, objId, visit)
    "pfsObjectLsf-%05d-%05d-%s-%016x-%03d-0x%016x.pickle" % (catId, tract, patch, objId, nVisit, pfsVisitHash)

These correspond to the corresponding FITS product without the "Lsf", e.g.
    "pfsArm-%06d-%1s%1d.fits" % (visit, arm, spectrograph)

The pickle files can be read in python using the following function:

    def readLsfPickle(filename):
        """Read the line-spread function from a pickle file"""
        import pickle
        import pfs.drp.stella  # Load class definitions
        with open(filename, "rb") as fd:
            return pickle.load(fd)

This will return either a single Lsf object (for pfsSingleLsf and pfsObjectLsf
files) or a python dictionary of Lsf objects, indexed by fiberId (in the case of
pfsArmLsf and pfsMergedLsf files).

Pixel mask values

We use bit masks to flag pixels in the images and spectra. The bit masks have
symbolic names that are recorded in the FITS headers with a prefix "MP_" (or
"HIERARCH MP_" for longer names), and a value equal to the power of two for the
corresponding value. For example, "MP_FOO = 5" would mean that the symbolic name
"FOO" has the corresponding value of 0x00000020.

The meanings of the symbolic names are:

BAD: the pixel is a known bad pixel
SAT: the pixel was saturated
INTRP: the pixel has been interpolated
CR: the pixel is believed to be affected by a cosmic ray
EDGE: the pixel is close to the edge of the image (from LSST; not relevant for PFS)
DETECTED: the pixel has a positive value over threshold (from LSST; not relevant for PFS)
DETECTED_NEGATIVE: the pixel has a negative value over threshold (from LSST; not relevant for PFS)
SUSPECT: the pixel is suspected to be non-linear
NO_DATA: there are no good value for this value
UNMASKEDNAN: the pixel contained a NAN
BAD_FLAT: the pixel is bad in the flat
FIBERTRACE: the pixel is part of a fiber trace
BAD_SKY: the pixel is bad in the sky model
BAD_FLUXCAL: the pixel is bad in the flux calibration
OVERLAP: the pixel is part of a wavelength overlap (dichroic)

Simulations

We need to specify a format for the spectra going into the simulator.  At first glance we could adopt the
pfsObject file, along with a pfsDesign file to map them to the sky.  This would work, but there is a problem
with resolution, in particular emission lines.  Also, the resolution of the pfsObject files for
medium-resolution spectra may be different from that for low-resolution (extra-galactic) spectra (and the
simulators are probably not interested in covariances and masks)

The PSF of an extracted emission line is not the same as the marginal shape of the fibre spot, and I don't
think that the simulators want to know the details of the spectrograph anyway!  This leads us to going to
higher resolution, and this would be possible (e.g. R ~ 1e4?).  An alternative would be to provide the
continuum spectrum as an array, possibly even at PFS's resolution and an additional table of (lambda,
amplitude, width) for emission lines.  Will a continuum + lines model like this work for the Galactic
evolution stellar spectra?

For now, I propose:
     "pfsSimObject-%05d-%05d-%s-%016x.fits" % (catId, tract, patch, objId)

The tract, patch, catId, objId values will also be available as header keywords.

The file will have two HDUs:

HDU #0 PDU
HDU #1             Flux in units of nJy     	   	       [FLOAT]        NSIMROW
HDU #2 WAVELENGTH  Wavelength solution in nm (vacuum)	   [64-bit FLOAT] NSIMROW

The simulation team will also need to provide a matching pfsDesign file, and may well choose to set
   tract, patch = 0, "0,0"
The catId/objId is only needed to allow the set of pfsSimObject files and a pfsDesign file to specify a
set of simulated exposures.

Note that the wavelength need not be uniformly sampled.

Redshift candidates


According to the "combined spectra" data model we include both the number of
visits (nVisit) and a SHA-1 hash of the visits, pfsVisitHash.

I propose :
		"pfsZcandidates-%05d-%05d-%s-%016x-%03d-0x%016x.fits"
        % (catId, tract, patch, objId, nVisit % 1000, pfsVisitHash)

The path would be
   tract/patch/pfsZcandidate-*.fits

The file will have several HDUs:

     tract       INT         Tract identifier
     patch       KEYWORD     Patch identifier

			Parameters
			----------

The raw CCD images will have:
    NAMP=8
    AMPCOLS=520
    CCDROWS=4224

    OVERROWS = 76 # as of 2016-02-01
    OVERCOLS = 32 # as of 2016-02-01

    LEADINROWS = 48 # necked rows
    LEADINCOLS  = 8 # real leadin pixels

So the raw CCD data will have
    NROW = 4300 #  CCDROWS + OVERROWS
    NCOL = 4416 # NAMP*(AMPCOLS + OVERCOLS)

And the ISR-extracted CCD images will probably be close to:
    NROW = 4176  # CCDROWS - LEADINROWS
    NCOL = 4096  # NAMP*(AMPCOLS - LEADINCOLS)
This value of NROW is applicable to the pfsArm files.

The raw H4RG images will be in the range
    NROW = 4096 to 8192
    NCOL = 4096
(n.b. there's a 4-pixel reference pixel border)

The ISR-extracted H4RG images will be no bigger than
    NROW = 4088
    NCOL = 4088

			Open Questions and TBD
			----------------------

	Pin down the HDUs in pfsArm files

	Specify more details about expected header keywords

	Provide examples of all these files

	Decide where to put information about the analysis resulting in pfsArm files

	Define the 1-D outputs

	Define pfsObject files for medium resolution data

	Consider using healpix or HTM ID not tract/patch

	Do we need to save the covariance of the wavelength solution

	Should we save the per-pfsDesignId combined spectra?  Note that this is doable within
	my naming scheme now we have added a pfsVisitHash and an nVisit field

	Reruns in directory tree, and also headers of course

	DB of bad visits

	Define format of pfsPSF files.  Choosing a better name is probably hopeless

	Need a DB (as well as the butler) to map visit to visit0 for calibration products

	Do we want to model the sky over the entire exposure?  I put in a place holder that is
	per spectrograph/arm but it isn't obvious that this is correct.  E.g. there's spatial
	structure over the whole focal plane, and the lines in the red and IR are closely related.

	Think of a better name than NCOARSE

	Do we really want HDU #1 (rebinned spectra) in medium-resolution pfsObject files to
	omit the blue and IR data?
